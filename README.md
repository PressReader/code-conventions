# C# code conventions

- The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute
- Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live
- Do not write "smart" code that is difficult to read by others.
- The Boy Scout Rule: "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it".

## Why do we need this

Coding conventions serve the following purposes:
- They create a consistent look to the code, so that reeaders can focus on content, not layout.
- They enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience.
- They facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.
 
## Design Guidelines

All `PressReader` projects should follow [Microsoft Framework Design Guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx). In addition to this document we agree to follow coding conventions below.

## Formatting

Use **utf-8** charset for all files in the project. Use **4 space indentation** for *.cs files in the project. 
Please use [EditorConfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for your IDE to automatically set these settings for your project.

## Layout

- Use separate file for each entity (class, interface, enum) unless it's logically necessary.
- Don't use **#region** and **#endregion** directives
- Write only one statement/declaration per line.
- Add at least one blank line between method definitions, property definitions, constructors etc.

```
public class Example
{
    public Example() 
    {
        IsActive = true;
    }
    
    public string IsActive { get; set; }
  
    public void Write(char value) 
    {
        if (IsActive) 
        {
            Console.WriteLine(value)'
        }
    }
}
```

## Ð¡urly brackets
- Always use curly brackets even for one line code, place your statement on the next line:
```C#
if (a == "b") 
{
    Consloe.WriteLine("A equals to B");
    return;
}
```

- Note: for one line null-checks with exception throw statement it's allowed to use the same line.
```C#
if (catalogManager == null)  { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(catalogManager)); }
```

## Implicitly Typed Local Variables

- Use `var` wherever it possible instead of explicit type.
- Do not include the type of the variable in it's name.

```
var z = new List<string>();
```


## Comments
- Don't comment redundant code, not used code should be removed.
- Place the comment on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code.
- Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//) and the comment text, as shown in the following example.
```
// Region of the default user, used for test purposes
private const long RegionId = 1231231;
```
- For xml comments begin comment text with an uppercase letter and end with a period.
```
/// <summary>
/// Generates slugged URL from a string value.
/// </summary>
public static string GenerateSlug(string value)
```
